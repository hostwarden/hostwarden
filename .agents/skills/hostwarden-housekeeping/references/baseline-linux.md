# Baseline Checks — Linux

Run these on every Linux server.

The commands below are the family defaults. Where the loaded OS file
covers a check — its Package Manager, Automatic Security Updates,
Firewall or Updates section — its commands and expectations win, at
the same severities: a mechanism the OS file says is not expected is
not a finding.

Alpine has no systemd and a busybox userland whose commands take
fewer flags (`rules/os/alpine.md` → Notes). Where a check below
would fail there, an **Alpine** variant follows it; a check
without one runs unchanged.

## Backup Presence

Run the generic "any backup at all?" check — see
`references/backup-presence.md`. It runs on every host,
independent of `memory.md` service entries.

## Disk Usage

```bash
df -h --output=target,pcent,size,used,avail \
  -x tmpfs -x devtmpfs -x overlay
```

**Alpine** (busybox `df` has no `--output` or `-x`):

```bash
df -h | grep -vE '^(tmpfs|devtmpfs|overlay|shm|none) '
```

- **WARN** if any filesystem > 85% used
- **CRITICAL** if any filesystem > 95% used

## Memory and Swap

```bash
free -h
```

Report total, used, and available memory.

- **WARN** if available memory < 10% of total
- **WARN** if swap usage > 50% of total swap

## System Load

```bash
uptime
nproc
```

Report 1m, 5m, 15m load averages and core count.

- **WARN** if 15-minute load average > core count

## Uptime and Reboot Detection

```bash
uptime -s
last reboot | head -5
```

**Alpine:** busybox `uptime` takes no options and busybox `last`
no filter; `uptime` alone gives the time since boot.

Report uptime. If the server rebooted since the last housekeeping
or last session, flag it:

- **INFO** unexpected reboot detected (compare with memory file's
  last known uptime or last connected date)

## Pending Security Updates

Use the distro-specific command from the loaded `rules/os/<family>.md`
file. Report two numbers where cheap: total pending upgrades and
the security-only subset. Do not present the total as "security
updates" — that overstates the finding.

The security-filter syntax varies by distro release. Per "Verify
Before Running" in `AGENTS.md`, verify the flags with `--help` on
the target before relying on them.

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
apt-get update -qq 2>/dev/null

# Total pending upgrades.
apt-get --just-print upgrade 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -c "^Inst"

# Security-only subset: filter the Inst lines for
# security origins (Debian-Security on older
# releases, <codename>-security on newer ones,
# <codename>-security on Ubuntu).
apt-get --just-print upgrade 2>/dev/null \
  | grep "^Inst" \
  | grep -ciE "debian-security|[a-z]+-security"
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**

```bash
# Total pending updates.
dnf check-update --quiet 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -c "^\S"

# Security-only subset.
dnf updateinfo --security 2>/dev/null
dnf check-update --security --quiet 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -c "^\S"
```

**SUSE:**

```bash
# Total pending updates.
zypper --quiet list-updates 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -c "^v"

# Security-only subset.
zypper list-patches --category security 2>/dev/null
```

**Alpine:**

```bash
apk update -q
apk list --upgradable
```

apk has no security-only view. Report the total and say that no
subset exists; the security fixes a package carries are listed on
<https://security.alpinelinux.org/>. Check the branch and the
repositories as `rules/os/alpine.md` → Stable Branch Only and
Version Detection describe.

- **WARN** if any security updates are pending
- Report both counts (total pending and security-only)

## Automatic Security Updates

Verify that auto-updates are actually installing security
updates, not just that the unit is enabled. A unit can be
"active" while the daily run does nothing. Real-world failure
modes that the simple `is-active` check misses:

- `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades` missing or zeroed
  out: the timer fires but `APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade`
  is `0`, so the daily run exits after one second.
- `Origins-Pattern` missing the `${distro_codename}-security`
  codename on Debian Trixie or later: `security.debian.org`
  publishes there with the `-security` codename, so security
  packages fail the filter even though
  `apt-cache policy` shows them as the install candidate.
- No `Mail` or `MailReport` set: UA errors never surface.
- Timer alive but only installing third-party packages
  (e.g. `mise`): the Debian security archive is unreachable
  for some reason and nobody knows.

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
# 1. Package present.
dpkg -l unattended-upgrades 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -q "^ii" && echo "pkg=ok" || echo "pkg=MISSING"

# 2. Daily timer enabled.
systemctl is-enabled apt-daily-upgrade.timer 2>/dev/null

# 3. APT::Periodic actually turns the runs on.
apt-config dump APT::Periodic 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -E "(Update-Package-Lists|Unattended-Upgrade) "

# 4. Origins-Pattern covers the codename-security archive
#    (Debian Trixie+ publishes Codename: <release>-security).
codename=$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
pattern="codename=\\\$\{distro_codename\}-security"
pattern="${pattern}|codename=${codename}-security"
apt-config dump Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern \
  2>/dev/null \
  | grep -qE "$pattern" \
  && echo "origins=ok" \
  || echo "origins=MISSING ${codename}-security pattern"

# 5. Notification destination set (else failures are silent).
apt-config dump 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -E "Unattended-Upgrade::(Mail |MailReport)"

# 6. Recent real activity: did a Debian package upgrade run
#    in the last 30 days, not just no-op runs?
zgrep -h "Pakete, welche aktualisiert werden\|Packages that will be upgraded" \
  /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log* \
  2>/dev/null | tail -5
```

Severity rules (Debian-specific):

- **CRITICAL** if `20auto-upgrades` is missing or any of its
  values is `0`. The timer fires but does nothing — silent
  total failure.
- **CRITICAL** if `Origins-Pattern` is missing the
  `${distro_codename}-security` entry on Trixie or later.
  Every Debian security update is silently skipped.
- **WARN** if neither `Mail` nor `MailReport` is set. UA
  errors will be invisible.
- **WARN** if the log shows no Debian package upgrade lines
  in the last 30 days despite the timer running daily. UA is
  alive but accomplishing nothing for the Debian archive.
- **INFO** if `Automatic-Reboot-Time` is set to a fixed
  HH:MM: this defers the post-kernel reboot to that time
  the next day, leaving the new userland on the old kernel
  for up to ~24 hours (vulnerability window plus risk of
  userland/kernel ABI mismatch). Prefer the default ("now")
  so reboot follows the apt-daily-upgrade morning slot.

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**

```bash
systemctl is-active dnf-automatic.timer 2>/dev/null \
  || systemctl is-active yum-cron.service 2>/dev/null
```

**SUSE:**

Check if `zypper-patch` or equivalent auto-update timer is
configured.

**Alpine:** nothing is built in. Look for what the user set up,
as `rules/os/alpine.md` → Automatic Security Updates describes:

```bash
ls /etc/periodic/*/ 2>/dev/null
crontab -l 2>/dev/null | grep apk
rc-service crond status
```

- **WARN** if no job runs `apk upgrade`, or `crond` is not
  started. Say that Alpine ships no mechanism, so this is a gap
  to discuss, not a broken setup.

- **WARN** if auto-update mechanism is not active

## Firewall Status

Check that the firewall is still active.

**Debian/Ubuntu (ufw):**

```bash
ufw status
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora (firewalld):**

```bash
firewall-cmd --state
```

**SUSE (firewalld):**

```bash
firewall-cmd --state
```

**Alpine:** nftables, awall or ufw, whichever the host runs:

```bash
rc-service nftables status
rc-service iptables status
ufw status
rc-update show boot default
```

A running `iptables` service with policies in `/etc/awall/` is
awall. For nftables, judge default deny with the security
skill's probe, below.

**Native nftables** (Debian installs it, with its unit
off; check it when neither ufw nor firewalld is active;
needs root).

The probe and what counts as default deny are the security
skill's, in
`.agents/skills/hostwarden-security/references/firewall-nftables-docker.md`
— run it from there rather than from a copy here. It carries
the reason the grep is shaped the way it is, which a copy
loses the first time someone tidies it: input chains that
fail2ban or Docker add with `policy accept;` are not a
firewall, and neither is the stock config's empty chain.

What housekeeping does with the answer is below.

- **WARN** if ufw or firewalld is active and
  `systemctl is-enabled nftables` says `enabled`: the
  stock `/etc/nftables.conf` flushes their rules.

**Docker** (when `command -v docker` finds it):

```bash
docker ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Ports}}'
```

- **WARN** for each published port (`->`) not bound to
  `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`: Docker routes it past ufw and
  firewalld. OK if a `DOCKER-USER` rule restricts it (same
  reference), or if server memory records the port as
  meant to be public. When the user confirms that, add it
  there so the next run stays quiet.

- **CRITICAL** if the firewall is inactive or not installed

## Failed systemd Units

```bash
systemctl --failed --no-pager --no-legend
```

**Alpine** (OpenRC):

```bash
rc-status --crashed
rc-status default
```

`rc-status --crashed` exits non-zero when nothing crashed. In
`rc-status default`, a service shown as `stopped` was enabled but
is not running.

- **WARN** for each failed unit, crashed service, or enabled
  service that is stopped — list them by name

## NTP / Time Sync

```bash
timedatectl show \
  --property=NTPSynchronized --value
```

**Alpine:** no `timedatectl`. The default is busybox `ntpd`,
which reports no sync state; check that a time service runs:

```bash
rc-status default | grep -E 'ntpd|chronyd|openntpd'
command -v chronyc && chronyc tracking
```

`chronyc tracking` reports `Leap status : Normal` when chrony is
synchronised.

- **WARN** if NTP is not synchronized, or on Alpine if no time
  service runs

## Log Anomalies

Check for recent critical events:

```bash
# OOM kills in the last 7 days
journalctl --since "7 days ago" -k \
  --grep="Out of memory" --no-pager -q 2>/dev/null \
  | wc -l

# Disk errors in the last 7 days
journalctl --since "7 days ago" -k \
  --grep="I/O error" --no-pager -q 2>/dev/null \
  | wc -l

# Failed SSH auth in the last 24 hours
journalctl --since "24 hours ago" -u ssh -u sshd \
  --grep="Failed password" --no-pager -q 2>/dev/null \
  | wc -l
```

**Alpine** (syslog, `rules/os/alpine.md` → Logs; reading the file
needs root or membership in `wheel` or `adm`):

```bash
dmesg | grep -c "Out of memory"
dmesg | grep -c "I/O error"
grep -h "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log \
  /var/log/messages 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

`dmesg` holds only what the kernel buffer still has, and the log
files only what rotation kept: report the counts as recent, not
as 7 days or 24 hours.

- **WARN** if any OOM kills found
- **WARN** if any disk I/O errors found
- **INFO** if > 100 failed SSH logins in 24 hours (may indicate
  brute-force attempts)

## SSL/TLS Certificate Expiry

Only check if the server runs a web server or any TLS-enabled
service (check `memory.md` for nginx, Apache, etc.).

```bash
# Check all certs in /etc/letsencrypt/live/
for cert in /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/cert.pem; do
  domain=$(basename "$(dirname "$cert")")
  expiry=$(openssl x509 -enddate -noout \
    -in "$cert" 2>/dev/null \
    | cut -d= -f2)
  days=$(( ($(date -d "$expiry" +%s) \
    - $(date +%s)) / 86400 ))
  echo "$domain: ${days}d remaining"
done
```

**Alpine:** busybox `date -d` cannot parse the date `openssl`
prints. Ask `openssl` instead whether the certificate outlives a
threshold:

```bash
for cert in /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/cert.pem; do
  domain=$(basename "$(dirname "$cert")")
  openssl x509 -checkend 604800 -noout -in "$cert" \
    >/dev/null || echo "$domain: expires within 7 days"
  openssl x509 -checkend 2592000 -noout -in "$cert" \
    >/dev/null || echo "$domain: expires within 30 days"
done
```

If no Let's Encrypt certs exist, try checking via the listening
port:

```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 \
  -servername "$(hostname -f)" 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -enddate -noout 2>/dev/null
```

- **CRITICAL** if any cert expires in < 7 days
- **WARN** if any cert expires in < 30 days

## Kernel: Running vs Installed

Check whether a reboot is needed for a kernel update.

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
running=$(uname -r)
installed=$(dpkg -l 'linux-image-*' 2>/dev/null \
  | grep "^ii" | awk '{print $2}' \
  | sed 's/linux-image-//' | sort -V | tail -1)
echo "Running: $running"
echo "Installed: $installed"
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**

```bash
running=$(uname -r)
installed=$(rpm -q kernel --qf '%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{ARCH}\n' \
  | sort -V | tail -1)
echo "Running: $running"
echo "Installed: $installed"
```

**Alpine:** a kernel upgrade replaces the running kernel's
modules, so a missing directory means a newer kernel waits for a
reboot. Skip in a container, where the kernel is the host's:

```bash
uname -r
ls /lib/modules
```

- **INFO** if running kernel differs from installed (reboot
  recommended)

## Critical Services: Running Binary vs Installed Package

A package upgrade installs new bytes on disk, but the
already-running master keeps the old binary mapped in
memory until the service is reloaded or restarted. After
a package upgrade, `needrestart` may also defer some
services because restarting them is risky (notably
`docker.service`, `dbus.service`, `getty@*`,
`systemd-logind`). The result: the security fix is
installed but not active, and nothing complains.

**Alpine:** no needrestart; use the manual fallback
below, which works with busybox.

**Debian/Ubuntu** (needrestart is in the default
install since Bookworm):

```bash
if command -v needrestart >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  needrestart -b -p 2>&1
fi
```

`needrestart -b` (batch) emits machine-readable
`NEEDRESTART-VER`, `NEEDRESTART-KCUR`, `NEEDRESTART-KEXP`,
`NEEDRESTART-KSTA`, `NEEDRESTART-UCSTA`, and one
`NEEDRESTART-SVC:` line per service that wants a restart.
Exit code: 0 = nothing, 1 = containers, 2 = services,
3 = kernel.

Manual fallback (any Linux), works without needrestart by
comparing the on-disk binary's mtime against the running
process's start time via `/proc/<pid>/exe`:

```bash
for svc in nginx postfix sshd postgres docker ollama \
           opendkim dovecot mariadbd; do
  pid=$(pgrep -o -x "$svc" 2>/dev/null) || continue
  bin=$(readlink -f "/proc/$pid/exe" 2>/dev/null) \
    || continue
  bin_time=$(stat -c %Y "$bin" 2>/dev/null) || continue
  proc_time=$(stat -c %Y "/proc/$pid" 2>/dev/null) \
    || continue
  if [ "$bin_time" -gt "$proc_time" ]; then
    echo "$svc: on-disk binary newer than running \
process (pkg installed after process started)"
  fi
done
```

- **WARN** for each critical service whose on-disk binary
  is newer than the running master. The security patch is
  installed but the running process has not picked it up.
- **INFO** if `needrestart` reports kernel or services
  that want a reboot/restart (`NEEDRESTART-KSTA` not 1, or
  any `NEEDRESTART-SVC:` line). For deferred services,
  reload is usually enough; for the kernel, only a reboot
  helps.
