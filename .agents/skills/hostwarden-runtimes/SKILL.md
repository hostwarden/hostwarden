  anything else mise carries. Use when the user asks to "install
  Node on <host>", "put the latest stable Ruby on this server",
  "upgrade Python", "which Node version is on web1", "install
  Rails", or names any language or framework that needs a runtime

# hostwarden-runtimes

Installing programming languages on servers using
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev). Applies to every distro family and
to macOS and FreeBSD alike.

**The policy, before the procedure:** a language runtime comes
from mise, never from the distribution's packages and never from
nvm, rbenv, pyenv or asdf. `rules/best-practices.md` carries the
reasoning under "Runtime via apt/dnf/zypper"; what it adds here
is that a second version manager on the same host is a second
source of truth. Either is fine when the user asks for it by
name — never by default, and never silently.

**Overrides.** Load them before anything else, key
`hostwarden-runtimes`, per `rules/overrides.md`.

## When to Use mise

Use mise for **language runtimes** — Node.js, Ruby,
Python, Elixir, Go, Java, etc. Do **not** use mise for
system tools or services (nginx, PostgreSQL, etc.) —
those should come from the distro's package manager.

## Common Pitfalls

- mise must be installed as the SSH user, not root.
  Running `mise use` as root installs runtimes for
  root only.
- The shims PATH setup in `~/.bashrc` must be
  **before** the interactive guard (`case $- in ...`).
  If placed after, `ssh user@host "command"` won't
  find mise-installed binaries.
- After installing a language, always verify over SSH:
  `ssh user@host "node --version"`. If it fails, the
  PATH setup is wrong.
- `mise use --global` sets the default version. Without
  `--global`, it creates a local `.tool-versions` file
  in the current directory.
- For standalone installs, `~/.local/bin` must be in
  PATH for the `mise` binary itself. This is separate
  from the shims directory (`~/.local/share/mise/shims`)
  which provides the language runtime binaries. Both
  must be in PATH.

## Pre-Install Check

Before installing mise, check whether it is already
present on the system. A system-wide installation
(via package manager) is preferred over a per-user
standalone install.

**Step 1 — Check if mise exists for the SSH user:**

```
# Remote
ssh user@host "command -v mise"

# Local
command -v mise
```

If `command -v mise` succeeds, mise is already
installed. Check the path to determine the type:

```
ssh user@host "which mise"
```

- **System-wide** (`/usr/bin/mise`,
  `/usr/local/bin/mise`): Use it as-is. Skip the
  Installation section. Proceed to SSH
  Non-Interactive Shell Setup (shims PATH still
  needs to be configured per user).
- **User-local** (`~/.local/bin/mise`): Use it
  as-is. Skip the Installation section. Proceed to
  SSH Non-Interactive Shell Setup if not already
  configured.

If `command -v mise` fails, proceed to Installation.

**Note:** When a system-wide mise is found, do
**not** install a second copy locally. The shims
directory (`~/.local/share/mise/shims`) is still
per-user and still needs PATH setup — only the
`~/.local/bin` part of the PATH setup can be
skipped.

## Installation

Only install mise when the Pre-Install Check found
no existing installation. mise is installed as
**the SSH user** (not root).

### Default: Standalone Installer (no root)

Always try this first. It works on any Linux distro,
needs no root or sudo, and avoids third-party repos.

```
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

- Installs to `~/.local/bin/mise`
- No root or sudo needed — works in unprivileged mode
- Works on all distro families
- Updates via `mise self-update`
- Requires `curl` (fall back to `wget` if unavailable:
  `wget -qO - https://mise.run | sh`)
- Does **not** modify shell config — the SSH
  Non-Interactive Shell Setup section handles PATH

After installing, add `~/.local/bin` to PATH in
`~/.bashrc` (before the interactive guard) so the
`mise` binary itself is found over SSH. This is
handled in the SSH Non-Interactive Shell Setup section
below.

### Alternative: Distro Package Manager (needs root)

Only use this when the user **explicitly prefers** it
and root access is available. **Ask the user before
adding the repo** — these are third-party repos.

Trade-offs:

- **Pro:** auto-updates via system package manager
- **Con:** requires root, adds a third-party repo,
  `mise self-update` is disabled

#### Debian & Ubuntu

```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gpg wget
install -d -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -qO - https://mise.jdx.dev/gpg-key.pub \
  | gpg --dearmor \
  | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/mise-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/mise-archive-keyring.gpg arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://mise.jdx.dev/deb stable main" \
  | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mise.list
apt-get update && apt-get install -y mise
```

#### RHEL & Fedora

```
dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
dnf config-manager --add-repo \
  https://mise.jdx.dev/rpm/mise.repo
dnf install -y mise
```

On RHEL 7/CentOS 7, use `yum` instead of `dnf`.

**Note:** `dnf config-manager` syntax differs
between dnf4 and dnf5, and the yum-era command is
`yum-config-manager` — check `--help` on the
target first.

#### SUSE

```
zypper addrepo \
  https://mise.jdx.dev/rpm/mise.repo mise
zypper refresh
zypper install -y mise
```

### Which Method to Use

1. **Check first:** run the Pre-Install Check. If
   mise already exists, skip installation entirely.
2. **Default:** standalone installer — always try
   this first when no mise is found.
3. **Alternative:** distro package — only when the
   user explicitly prefers it and root access is
   available.
4. **Unprivileged mode:** standalone installer is
   the only option (no root for package manager
   installs).

## SSH Non-Interactive Shell Setup

**This is critical.** All hostwarden work runs via
`ssh user@host "command"` — a non-interactive,
non-login shell where `.bashrc` is typically not
sourced.

**Check the user's login shell first** — the steps
below are **bash-only**:

```
getent passwd <user> | cut -d: -f7
```

- **bash:** follow the `.bashrc` / `.bash_profile`
  steps below.
- **zsh** (macOS default): put the PATH export in
  `~/.zshenv` — zsh sources it for every
  invocation, including non-interactive SSH
  commands.
- **sh / csh** (FreeBSD root commonly runs these):
  POSIX `sh` reads the file named by `$ENV`
  (commonly `~/.shrc`); `csh`/`tcsh` read
  `~/.cshrc` and use `setenv PATH ...` syntax.

For bash, add both `~/.local/bin` (for the
`mise` binary itself) and the shims directory (for
language runtimes) to `PATH` **at the top of
`~/.bashrc`** — before the interactive guard
(`case $- in ...`). This is the only reliable way to
get mise into `ssh user@host "command"` on
Debian/Ubuntu, because `~/.bash_profile` is **not**
sourced for non-login, non-interactive SSH commands.

```bash
# Insert at the very top of ~/.bashrc.
# The grep guard makes re-runs a no-op.
grep -q '# mise (before interactive guard)' ~/.bashrc || \
sed -i '1i# mise (before interactive guard)\
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"\
' ~/.bashrc
```

Also extend `~/.bash_profile` to source `.bashrc`
for interactive login shells and set XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
(needed for systemd user services over SSH). Back up
an existing file first (`rules/backups.md`), append
rather than overwrite, and guard with a marker so
re-runs are no-ops:

```bash
[ -f ~/.bash_profile ] && \
  cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.bak.$(date +%F)
grep -q '# mise shims' ~/.bash_profile 2>/dev/null || \
cat >> ~/.bash_profile << 'EOF'
# mise shims
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)

# Source .bashrc for interactive login shells
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ] && [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
    . "$HOME/.bashrc"
fi
EOF
```

**Verify it works:**

```
ssh user@host "mise --version"
ssh user@host "node --version"
```

If neither file is sourced, fall back to:

1. **Explicit PATH prefix** in commands:
   ```
   PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH" node -v
   ```
2. **`mise exec`** to run commands in a mise-managed
   environment:
   ```
   ~/.local/bin/mise exec -- node -v
   ```

## Installing Languages

Install languages **as the SSH user** (not root).
Web-search the current LTS/stable version first —
never trust training data (see CLAUDE.md). Use
`mise use --global` to set a default version:

```
mise use --global node@<current-LTS>
mise use --global ruby@<current-stable>
```

After installing, verify over SSH:

```
ssh user@host "node --version"
ssh user@host "ruby --version"
```

## Server Memory Convention

When mise and languages are installed, add a single
line to the server's `memory.md`:

```
- mise: node@<version>, ruby@<version>
```

Update this line whenever languages are added, removed,
or upgraded.
