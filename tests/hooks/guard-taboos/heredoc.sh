# --- heredoc bodies: data vs code (issue #8) -------------------
# Prose legitimately contains taboo words. A heredoc body is only
# exempt when its CONSUMER cannot execute it. The deny cases below
# are the ones that make the exemption safe; if any of them ever
# flips to pass, the exemption has become a hole.
#
# The exact command that exposed this: Hostwarden's own changelog
# write, blocked over the word inside the prose.
